# 🚀 42 Pipex 🚀
Hey fellow code explorers! This GitHub realm is where I've stashed the 42 Pipex project, a gem from the 42 course. Take a sneak peek into my coding adventures, but remember, face the challenges solo before diving into my solutions, savvy?

## What's Pipex, Anyway?
Pipex is a project that takes you on a journey through command-line wizardry. It's like mastering the art of pipelines and processes - a real coding spellbook! 🧙‍♂️

## Compile-it! 💻

Just a couple of magic spells to conjure your Pipex masterpiece:

- `make`: For a regular enchantment. Compile that code, and you're ready for action!
- `make bonus`: Feeling adventurous? Add the bonus ingredients for an extra boost.
- `make clean`: Clear away the traces of your enchantment. A tidy workspace is a powerful workspace.
- `make fclean`: Need a clean slate? This erases all enchantments, leaving nothing behind.
- `make debug`: Unleash the debug sorcery using lldb. Warning: It leaves behind extra mystical artifacts not handled by `make fclean`.

Navigate this mystical realm with these commands, and may your Pipex journey be legendary! 🌟🔮

## Cloning the Repository
Just hit this command and you're golden:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:RPDJF/42-pipex.git
```
